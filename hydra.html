                Hydra, also known as THC Hydra, is a powerful and popular open-source tool used for password cracking
                and brute-force attacks on various network services.
                It supports a wide range of protocols including FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, and more.
                Hydra is commonly used by penetration testers and security professionals to identify weak passwords and
                assess the security of systems.

            In short:
            Hydra helps you test the strength of passwords by attempting to guess them using different methods.

            <h3 id="install-header">
                To install Hydra, follow these steps based on your operating system:
            </h3>
            <ul id="install-list">
                <li><strong>Windows: </strong><em>(Recommended)</em> Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and then
                    install Hydra in the WSL distro (Ubuntu). This keeps things simple and safer than random pre-built
                    binaries.
                    <br>
                    <p># in PowerShell <strong>(one-time WSL install, if not already): </strong> <code class="code-copy">wsl --install</code></p>
                    <br>
                    <p># in Ubuntu (once WSL is installed): <code class="code-copy">sudo apt update && sudo apt install hydra</code></p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>If you must run natively on Windows, there are community pre-built packages (Cygwin-based).
                       Use caution — prefer official sources or build from source yourself.</strong></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Linux: </strong>Use your package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems, run
                    <code class="code-copy"><i>sudo apt-get install hydra</i></code>.
                    <br>
                    On Red Hat-based systems, use <code class="code-copy"><i>sudo yum install hydra</i></code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>macOS: </strong>Install via Homebrew by running <code class="code-copy"><i>brew install hydra</i></code>. If you
                    don’t have Homebrew, you can install it from <a href="https://brew.sh/">(Homebrew Website)</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>
