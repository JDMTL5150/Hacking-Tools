                Exploit Database (ExploitDB) is a comprehensive archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, maintained by Offensive Security.
                It serves as a valuable resource for penetration testers, security researchers, and IT professionals to identify and understand security vulnerabilities in various software applications and systems.
                The database includes a wide range of exploits for different platforms, including web applications, operating systems, and network devices.
                ExploitDB is widely used for educational purposes, vulnerability research, and to aid in the development of security tools and techniques.

                In short:
                ExploitDB helps you find known security weaknesses in software so you can protect systems better.

        <h2>How to Install ExploitDB</h2>
        <article id="install-instructions">
            <h3 id="install-header">
                To install ExploitDB, follow these steps based on your operating system:
            </h3>
            <ul id="install-list">
                <li><strong>Windows: </strong><em>(Recommended)</em> Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and then
                    install ExploitDB in the WSL distro (Ubuntu). This keeps things simple and safer than random pre-built
                    binaries.
                    <br>
                    <p># in PowerShell <strong>(one-time WSL install, if not already): </strong> <code class="code-copy">wsl --install</code></p>
                    <br>
                    <p># in Ubuntu (once WSL is installed): 
                        <code class="code-copy">sudo apt update && sudo apt install exploitdb</code></p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>If you must run natively on Windows, there are community pre-built packages (Cygwin-based).
                       Use caution â€” prefer official sources or build from source yourself.</strong></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Linux: </strong>Use your package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems, run
                    <code class="code-copy"><i>sudo apt-get install exploitdb</i></code>.
                    <br>
                    On Red Hat-based systems, use <code class="code-copy"><i>sudo yum install exploitdb</i></code>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>macOS:</strong> You can install ExploitDB using Homebrew by running
                    <code class="code-copy"><i>brew install exploitdb</i></code>. If you prefer, you can also download it from the official website and extract it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After installation, you can verify it by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing
                <code class="code-copy">searchsploit</code> to see if the tool is working correctly.
